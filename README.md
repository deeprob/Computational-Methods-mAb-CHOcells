# Computational Methods for Robust Bio-processing
This project accounts for my Master's thesis at Carnegie Mellon University 
# Project aim
The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts glycosylation in Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells. Here I looked at the advantages and disadvantages of both Physics based and Machine Learning based methods of modelling and finally developed a hybrid model that outputs real-time predictions of the relative glycan distribution in mAbs.
# Why is this project useful?
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a class of commercially valuable biopharmaceuticals that are used for treating diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple types of cancer. Maintaining the desired product quality of mAbs throughout the manufacturing process has been difficult for a variety of reasons. One of them is the lack of a robust dynamic mathematical model that can be generalized to different experimental conditions, media supplements and cell lines. According to me, this has mainly been due to the fact that physics based models need to be adjusted everytime there is even a tiny change in manufacturing conditions or when the initial formulation of media is varied or when we use different supplements or cell-lines. Therefore I have turned to Machine Learning based methods of modeling to fill that gap.
# Why have I looked at glycosylation?
Glycosylation is one of the most important determinant of mAb product quality. 
# Why Chinese Hamster Ovary cell lines?
While therapeutic mAbs can be synthesized in several different mammalian cell expression systems such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines, murine myeloma cell lines NS0, Sp2/0, over half of all currently approved mAbs are produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines (data accessed online from Drugs@FDA).
