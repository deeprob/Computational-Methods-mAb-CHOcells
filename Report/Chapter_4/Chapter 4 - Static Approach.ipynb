    "### Static Approach: Modeling the relative glycan distribution in monoclonal antibody using deep learning \n",
    "\n",
    "The development of a model that uses deep learning to predict the final relative glycan distribution of an antibody has been discussed here. The framework also known as the \"Static approach\" uses data driven techniques instead of first priciples based methods to predict glycan distribution. The aim of this project is not to understand the underlying physics behind glycosylation in monoclonal antibodies but to develop an efficient model that provides accurate and instantaneous predictions of the glycan distribution from experimental data. The model is also independent of cell lines and the addition of supplements. \n",
