    \subsection{The global pharmaceuticals
market}\label{the-global-pharmaceuticals-market}

The global market for pharmaceuticals reached \textbackslash{}\$1.2
trillion in 2018, up \textbackslash{}\$100 billion from 2017, according
to the Global Use of Medicines report from the IQVIA Institute for Human
Data Science. For the US specifically, the 2018 spending was
\textbackslash{}\$485 billion, up 5.2\% over the previous year.
\includegraphics{pharmaceuticals-market.jpg}

    \subsection{Rapid advancement of
biopharmaceuticals}\label{rapid-advancement-of-biopharmaceuticals}

At present, there has been a rapid advancement in the number of
biopharmaceuticals available for clinical use. The United States Food
and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved 18 new biopharmaceutical
products in 2012, which include eight recombinant proteins, along with
two monoclonal antibodies and one engineered antibody-like biomolecule,
covering a wide range of innovation, novelty, healthcare and market
impact. Research data released by PharmaVision in 2009 shows that
biopharmaceuticals represent 7.5\% of all drugs in the market and
account for \textasciitilde{}10\% of the total expenses for marketed
drugs. The usage of biopharmaceuticals are increasing at the rate
\textgreater{}20\% per year. They are already being used 74\% more than
chemically derived pharmaceuticals, in life-saving or end-stage
applications. Moreover, biopharmaceuticals covers \textgreater{} 30\% of
all pipeline research programs going-on at present.

    \subsection{Monoclonal Antibodies}\label{monoclonal-antibodies}

Glycoproteins, including monoclonal antibodies, represent the largest
fraction of marketed biopharmaceuticals and those in clinical
development. In 2015, global sales of the top 5 best-selling mAbs
(Humira®, Remicade®, Rituxan®, Avastin®, and Herceptin®), prescribed for
treating breast cancer, colon cancer, Crohn's disease to rheumatoid
arthritis, exceeded US \$45 billion, indicating the high commercial
value of these biotherapeutics. However, despite the therapeutic
benefits offered by these drugs, they present a financial burden on the
healthcare system, with increased drug pricing becoming a matter of
concern for both patients and policy makers (Araújo et al. 2016;
Kesselheim et al. 2016).

    \subsection{Interest in biosimilars}\label{interest-in-biosimilars}

As the patents providing exclusive rights to many of the high-profile
and blockbuster monoclonal antibody products expire, there has been a
growing interest in the development of biosimilars. In September 2013,
the first biosimilar monoclonal antibodies, sold under the brand names
Remsima and Inflectra, were approved for commercial sale in Europe.
These biosimilar versions of the blockbuster monoclonal antibody product
Remicade are the first of many biosimilar monoclonal antibodies that
will undoubtedly be approved for commercial sale in the US and Europe.
Although the current impact of these and other biosimilar monoclonal
antibody products in US and European biopharmaceutical marketplace
cannot be gauged at this early stage, we anticipate modest acceleration
of the sales growth of all monoclonal antibodies as these biosimilar
products gain market acceptance. There is also a surging interest in
biosimilar monoclonal antibodies in the global markets of Latin America,
China, Southeast Asia, India, and Russia, with several monoclonal
antibody products already approved in these regions. The introduction of
biosimilars in these markets is likely to have a very large impact on
the global sales of monoclonal antibody products as biosimilar
monoclonal antibodies are approved in geographies that are currently
unable to access expensive innovator products.

    \subsection{Characterization of complete quality
attributes}\label{characterization-of-complete-quality-attributes}

As biosimilars share an identical amino acid sequence with the innovator
molecule but differ only in their quality profiles, regulatory agencies
are seeking extensive characterization of the complete quality
attributes of the drug. The advent of biosimilars notwithstanding, there
is a shift in the focus from improving productivity, which has
dramatically increased with host cell optimization, to maintaining
consistent product quality across batches, in order to improve overall
profitability (Kelley 2009). Over the past decade, regulatory agencies
have also been encouraging the biopharmaceutical industry to implement
the `Quality by Design' framework, wherein quality related to drug
product safety and efficacy is in-built into every stage of the process,
as per ICH Q8 guidelines (del Val et al. 2010; Rathore et al. 2010;
Rathore and Winkle 2009). Maintaining drug product quality to ensure
product safety and efficacy has therefore come to occupy the center
stage of the biopharmaceutical industry.

    \subsection{Glycosylation in mAbs}\label{glycosylation-in-mabs}

One of the most important determinant of mAb quality is N-glycosylation,
a posttranslational modification of the antibody in which an
oligosaccharyltransferase complex in the endoplasmic reticulum adds a
sugar substrate (glycan) to the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif in the heavy chain
of the mAb (where X is any amino acid other than Pro). As the mAb
traverses the Golgi complex, the attached oligosaccharide is subjected
to a series of non-template driven enzymatic modifications mediated by
the localized glycosyltransferase enzymes in the different Golgi
compartments (Cumming 2003; Kornfeld and Kornfeld 1985). The intricate
dynamics of multiple glycosyltransferase enzymes determine the eventual
fate of the core glycan and result in the formation of a diverse array
of glycan isoforms that affect the immunogenicity, effector functions,
and the pharmacokinetic properties of the mAb, and consequently the
final drug product quality (Berger et al. 2012; del Val et al. 2010; Liu
2015). Thus, there is considerable motivation for manufacturers to
understand, characterize, and, if necessary, modulate the glycoform
distribution in mAbs in order to maintain a consistent glycan profile
and to meet the quality standards established by regulatory agencies
worldwide (FDA 2006; Harmonised Tripartite Guideline 2009; Read et al.
2011; Wacker et al. 2011). Therefore, the overall objective of this
thesis is \textbf{to provide a rational framework to quantitatively
model and estimate glycosylation in monoclonal antibodies produced in
mammalian cells}.
